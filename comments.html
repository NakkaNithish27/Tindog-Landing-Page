<!-- Three ways to add bootstrap,1)add bootstrap cdn link,2)use starter template,3)download bootsrap.css and link to it manually -->
<!-- Start by looking at other people websites,www.awwwards.com,ui-patterns.com -->
<!-- wire frame(sneakpeekit.com,balsamiq),mock up  -->
<!-- prototypes,www.dribble.com -->
<!-- everything is just a box,adding classes changes the look of the box. Copy code and customize it to your need-->
<!-- can add script tag just above </body> or below css link -->
<!-- bootstrap  can easily implement grid usig class='col' div inside class='row' div.
    can make layout responsive,ex:col-lg-3,in remaing screens it takes all 12 units. -->
<!-- link your css just after bootstrap css to overwrite bootstrap styles -->
<!-- add padding in % so it changes dynamically -->
<!-- To use font awesome icons we need to include font awesome script ,font awesome icons comes with different sizes-->
<!-- default z-index is 0.It can be -,+ and 0 ,
z-index works only if it is absolute/relative positioning,
absolute takes out of the html flow,relative keeps the flow-->
<!-- media queries
the css activates only when the conditions are true
 -->
<!-- Code Readability
Readability,Modularity,Efficiency,Length -->
<!-- always try to give custom classes
you can use advanced css selectors(can combine different css selectors)
try to use combinations,instead of adding new classes -->
<!-- try to find repetive patterns,like white text on coloured background and coloured text on white background  -->
<!-- use id's very sparringly,only use it on sections for navigation purposes,to target them in hrefs -->
<!-- dont use inline styles, Readability is more important than shortening the code -->
<!-- Web Design -->
<!-- COLOR THEORY
Differnet colors have different moods,choose wisely.
We use color palates,
colour wheel
adobe colors
colorhunt.co -->
<!-- TYPOGRAPHY
serif family type face(has little feet,looks serious)
San-serif (no feet,more readable)
Try to combine two fonts that have same mood.
-->
<!-- USER INTERFACE DESIGN
try to highlight the important things with the design using hierarchy.
In ui design 40 to 60 characters per line is good.
Reduce the number of alignment lines.
White space is also important.
Design the ui for the audience.
 -->
<!-- UX
1)Keep the design simple
2)Keep the design consistent through
3)Keep reading patterns in mind while designing(try to use F/Z pattern)
4)All platform design,make sure our website rearranges itself on differnt screens
5)Test by giving to other users-->
